# TermIt UI Setup Guide

This guide provides information on how to build and deploy TermIt UI.

## Build

### System Requirements

* NodeJS 9.x or later
* npm 6.x or later

### Setup

To build TermIt for **non**-development deployment, use the `build-prod` npm script.

The following parameters can be configured for the build:
* `serverUrl` specifies the URL where the TermIt backend is running
* `deployment` is used to disambiguate cookies and items in the local storage in case the client accesses
multiple TermIt instances
* `REACT_APP_ADMIN_REGISTRATION_ONLY` configures whether the login page should contain a link to registration or not. 
If the parameter is set to true, only administrators can add new users and there is no registration link

### Example

1. `npm install`
2. `serverUrl=https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/termit-server-dev deployment=dev REACT_APP_ADMIN_REGISTRATION_ONLY=true npm run build-prod`

## Deployment

Deployment is fairly simple, just take the content of the `build` folder generated by the build script
and copy it to a location accessible via HTTP(S), e.g., into an Apache HTTP server-managed location.

### Example

`cp -R build /var/www/termit/`
